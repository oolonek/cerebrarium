## Notes

**2021-01-06**

- Grabbed my first issue a few days ago.
- Seems I need a bit of ts/js + VSCode extension development primer so I've been on that for the last few days
- First going through [the typescript handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/) to get myself familiar with typescript.
- [Kevin](https://www.kevinslin.com/) has kindly offered help to get me started with contributing. The community is very welcoming to newcomers.

**2021-01-11**

- Scheduled a pairing sessions on 2021-01-13 7:30AM. 

[Writing Tests](https://dendron.so/notes/c84aa95c-83b9-4d52-90a1-eeec8f0ca84f.html)

- consider both single vault and multi-vault scenario.
  - `runLegacySingleWorkspaceTest`
  - `runLegacyMultiWorkspaceTest`
  - These set up mocks for single/multi vault testing.
    - example : [RenameNoteV2.test.ts](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/test/suite-integ/RenameNoteV2.test.ts#L131:L131)
  - [arguments](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/test/testUtilsV3.ts#L70:L70)
    - `ctx`
      - [vscode extension context](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#ExtensionContext)
      - collection of utilities private to an extension
    - `preSetupHook`
      - runs before init
    - `postSetupHook`
      - runs after init
    - `preActivateHook`
      - runs befor workspace activation
    - `postActivateHook`
      -

- [runJestHarnessV2](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/58b3587f1e44f54635f77f7395f7b756f18e0c84/packages/common-test-utils/src/utils.ts#L119)
  - use shimmed jest methods to assert equality of actual and expected test outcome.

- engine test setup
  1. initialize engine
  2. seed it with fixtures for testing
  - may require testing in multiple environments (plugin, CLI, server, engine)
  - may require multiple test runners (jest / mocha)

_Notes on pairing session_

Session goal

- Add a test for MarkdownPublishPod
- Show how tests are set up for Dendron

watch

```bash
cd bootstrap/scripts
./watch.sh
```

- Dendron is made up of a multiple typescript projects
- This script will watch all of them and compile them when you make change to the code.

Testing in Dendron

- All tests are managed with jest.
  - Except the plugin itself, which uses mocha
    - mocha is very well integrated into VSCode's [test harness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_harness)
- Any test code that are not testing plugin functionality are
  - located in the `__tests__` directory
  - in the file name formatted `TestName.spec.ts`
- To run a test, use VSCode tasks
  - `cmd` + `shift` + `p`, -> `Task: Run Task` in the command palette
  - Select the appropriate task to run.
    - These are vscode wrappers around bash scripts.
  - In our case, we want to test `MarkdownPod.spec.ts`
  - Type `npm:test:watch` in the task comman palette
  - There will be a number of selections, marked with which project's test it will be running.
    - Select the one marked with `pods-core`, as we are testing pods today.
  - This will open a terminal and run `jest --watch` on the specific test we are interested in.
    - Now jest will run all the tests for you every time you change your test code
- Writing new tests
  - Start a new [describe block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#describename-fn), and give it an appropriate name.
  - Write a new test case.
    - Use `runEngineTest`
      - Multiple versions of this exists
      - Make sure you import the right version of this.
        - This is a typescript thing (?)
    - There are preset scenarios for testing
      - These are `PreSetupHookFunctions`
      - They set up hard-coded notes in a vault so that they can be used in a test
  - Quick jest tip: use snapshots to grab a test result (something long that you don't really want to construct manually), and use that for your assertions
    - These can be found in `__tests__/__snapshots__`
    - Don't forget to remove the snapshot code for the final test code if it isn't necessary.
  - Clean up any unused code / warnings
- After writing all the tests, check again by running the entire test suite
  - Run `Test: bootstrap` found under `Task: Run Task`
    - This will all tests in all packages.
    - We want to do this before commiting because Dendron is a mono-repo, and most packages have dependencies on each other.
    - We want to make sure our changes aren't breaking something elsewhere.
    - Github action that will automatically do this for every push will be coming soon.
- If you want to be more careful, you can also test the plugin itself at this point.
  - The above step tests every single package that is not a plugin.
  - To run tests for the plugin itself, run `Extension Integ Tests (plugin-core)`, which can be found in the Run pane.
