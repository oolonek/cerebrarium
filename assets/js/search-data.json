Maybe it's because I find it boring? It's an essential part of a modular system but on paper it's such a simple device.\n\nThis time I finally remembered to plan a Veils build, but I recieved a blemished panel, which rubbed me in the wrong way. Coincidentally, good panels are out of stock and I will have to wait a few weeks / months to get a replacement. Many angry e-mails have been sent back and forth with the vendor.\n\nI eventually calmed down and ordered the required components for the build. However I realized later on that the PCBs are a 0603 adaptation of Veils and I ordered 0402 components. Some kind of karma I guess.\n\nThis is not a huge problem though. I have a few options from here.\n\n1. Build it with 0402 components anyways\n2. Use this as an opportunity to learn how to order pcbs / fr4 panels from a pcb manufacturing service.\n\nBoth are viable options, but since Veils v2 hardware designs are released, I want to try ordering pcbs and panels for that instead of these. My original intention for building the v1 was to at least have VCAs in my system while I wait for v2.\n\nAll components other than the 0402 packages seem to be identical. I just have to try to fit the 0402 packages between the pads spaced for 0603. This will be a bit tricky because I have to figure out how much solder paste I have to apply for each pad to compensate for the spacing difference. Luckily, I have two to build.\n\n**2020-12-31 8:43 PM**\n\nShortly after I realized I ordered wrong packages for the build, I had to find something to control my frustration. The blemish panels for Veils was giving me bad vibes and I didn't want to look at them again. \n\nSo I grabbed a sanding disc and started peeling off the anodization and silk screen. After a few angry passes and then some with a finer grit, it looked pretty good. Not a perfect finish but miles better than looking at a b-stock panel.\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-12-31-21-30-50.png)\n_blemish panel vs sanded panel_\n\nThe finish isn't perfect, but I like the gritty look of the raw panels. I could keep it as is or polish it more. Maybe sticker bomb it? It will be a good panel to experiment stuff on.\n\nI should look into making my own [[panels|cerebrarium.music.synth.diy.panels]]\n\n**2021-01-06 11:15 PM**\n\nThe components arrived. 0402 components are... way too small.\nI'll wait until the weekend to try building one of the veils.\n\nLooks like the 0603 adapted pads have just enough space to fit a 0402 components between them, so it's definitely possible to use the original size.\n\nI tried picking one of the resistors up with a tweezer and to my surprise, I think the static makes it stick to the tweezers. I guess they aren't ESD like they are advertized?\nI always clean them with IPA so it's not sticking onto the residual flux for sure.\n\n**2021-01-09 3:20 PM**\n\n- Started building.\n- Sorted components by size.\n    - 0402 resistors\n    - 0402 capacitors\n    - the rest\n\n**2021-01-09 3:48 PM**\n\nFinished applying solder paste\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-01-09-15-49-23.png)\n\n**2021-01-09 6:47 PM**\n\nComponents all placed\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-01-09-18-47-54.png)\n\n**2021-01-09 7:06 PM**\n\nFlow on heat plate.\n\n- preheat to 100C\n- place pcb around 85C\n- when 100C reached, crank up to 230C\n- flow complete around 215C\n- turn off heatplate, keep pcb on plate\n- take pcb of plate\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-01-09-19-07-27.png)\n\n**2021-01-09 7:16 PM**\n\nInspection\nlooking for bridges, inconsistent joints, and any shorts.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-01-09-19-17-09.png)\n*bridges on IC*\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-01-09-19-18-35.png)\n*capacitor stands up and only soldered to one pad*\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-01-09-19-20-20.png)\n*inconsistent solder amount of each pad*\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-01-09-19-21-38.png)\n*balled up joint and resistor trying to escape*\n\n**2021-01-09 9:12 PM**\n\n- soldered all through-hole components after checking for shorts\n- tested each channels individually for functionality before soldering. worked fine\n\n**2021-01-10 2:14 AM**\n\n- Individual channels worked fine but daisy chaining was a bit wonky.\n- After hours of troubleshooting with a few friends, narrowed it down to a problem occuring between the cascade mixing of channel 2 and channel 3\n- As a result, channels 3 and 4's outputs were weaker and inverted.\n![](/assets/images/2021-01-10-02-18-51.png)\n*channel 2, 3, 4 output signal should be identical to channel 1's output signal, but channel 3 and 4's output are inverted and weak (dim and green)*\n\n- After many solder joint touch-ups, identified IC4's pins 8 and/or 9 were the culprit.\n- What was happening, was the 2 OPAMPs between channels 2 and 3 were inverting the signal twice while gain staging, and the second OPAMP had a faulty solder joint. which lead to the signal not inverting back, and also going through a nearby resistor which made it weak.\n\n- working as intended now\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-01-10-02-25-01.png)\n*finished module*\n\n# Build debrief\n- \n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/8eb1b18c-88cb-4b02-88cf-f0675b395131.html","relUrl":"notes/8eb1b18c-88cb-4b02-88cf-f0675b395131.html"},{"doc":"Teletype","title":"Teletype","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.teletype","content":"# Monome Teletype\n\n[Official website](https://monome.org/docs/teletype/)\n\n[Repo for software](https://github.com/monome/teletype)\n\n[Repo for hardware](https://github.com/monome/teletype-hardware)\n\n## build log\n\n- purchased panels and pcb on 2020-11-30\n- purchased components on 2020-12-19 (digikey)\n    1.

Had to look for the datasheets for these and order alternatives. Hopefully they will fit.\n\n- Along with the [[Veils panels|cerebrarium.music.synth.module.veils]], the panels for these were scratched. Perpendicular to the aluminum brushing. I suspect poor packaging on the seller's end. It was shoved in a plastic baggy barely big enough to fit both the panels and the pcb with no other protection (just in a box with a dozen more pcbs and panels). I was more frustrated with the poor quality of the Veils panels so I didn't mention these. \n\n**2021-01-06 11:19 PM**\n- Rest of the components that were missing arrived with the veils component order.\n- I'm pretty excited for this build.

This is a problem with component placement, or the amount of paste on one side of the pad. Usually the component will stand up on it's own if there was too much solder paste on one side though\n    ![](/assets/images/2021-01-16-21-49-42.png)\n    - Another ball-up. This one is a bit subtle but from the sides I can see that the resistor is slightly lifted on one side. The balled up side actually does not have contact with the pad/solder\n    ![](/assets/images/2021-01-16-21-53-40.png)\n    - This is an odd one. Solder balled up on the component and not on the pad. This is most likely due to dried up solder paste and slightly lifted component.\n    - It's possible that the pad has contact with the component, but I will touch this up just in case\n    ![](/assets/images/2021-01-16-22-07-57.png)\n    - Rouge ball of solder on each side of the 1206 capacitor.\n    - Simply running the iron and dragging it to one side of the pad will fix this.\n    - I can see this on every single 1206 package.\n    ![](/assets/images/2021-01-16-22-09-13.png)\n- Loupé\n    - Another check with a loupé as a microscope is limited to a bird's eye view and its resolution\n\n**2021-01-17 12:00 PM**\n- Yesterday, after inspection I cleaned up bridges and dry joints.\n- Due to the amount of solder paste, I had to wick away some solder from the bridges on the STM32.\n    - As a result, I took away a bit too much solder, which resulted in a (potentional) dry joint\n    ![](/assets/images/2021-01-17-12-02-42.png)\n    - I remedied this by applying a lot of flux, then dragging the iron along the pins to evenly distribute the existing solder to the pins that have dry joints.\n        - On some sides there weren't enough left to drag around, so I tinned the iron with the tiniest amount of solder and did the same. with enough flux, this will not bridge the pins.\n        - Just the right amount of solder would be left behind on each joint\n        ![](/assets/images/2021-01-17-15-15-26.png)\n- Soldered all the hardware except the potentiometer and jacks.\n- Turns out the DIP socket + pin headers listed in the Bill of Materials for the OLED header lifts the screen a tiny bit too high. There is not enough space between the screen and the panel for the panel to fit.\n    - I could substitue them with low profile sockets, but I didn't have it stocked.\n    - It would have also worked if I replaced only the male headers, but unfortunately these male headers do not fit in DIP sockets.\n    - At this point, my option is to:\n        1. Purchase low profile sockets (mouser reference : [517-929984-01-20-RK](https://kr.mouser.com/ProductDetail/3M-Electronic-Solutions-Division/929984-01-20-RK/?qs=%2Fha2pyFaduh65k0%252BENFIKH%2FjmgqQmrFcQW016WE0H3Ua5m7VtlBHQinfFgBmn0lN&utm_source=octopart&utm_medium=aggregator&utm_campaign=517-929984-01-20-RK&utm_content=3M))\n        2. Pull out a few pins and hack up my own headers.\n    - Safest bet is to go with the low profile sockets. These are the same ones used for the Westlicht Performer.\n- Technically, at this point I could power it up and see if it flashes properly. If it doesn't flash properly, I need to work on the STM32 joints again.\n- I decided to wait until I get the height of the screen properly before flashing, because having a screen just feels better when the module boots up.\n\n**2021-01-17 3:18 PM**\n- I will have to add the proper headers for the screens in my next mouser cart.\n- I have the Fade, Kinks, Plaits, Stages left to build, so I'll choose one and order the components with the headers I need.\n\n**2021-01-22 9:56 PM**\n- Replacement headers arrived\n- Desoldering original\n\n**2021-01-22 10:59 PM**\n- Finished desoldering original\n- It was a pain in the ass\n- Preci-dip 20 pin connectors are a pain in the fucking ass to desolder\n- CHECK LEVELS OF ANY OLED SCREEN WITH THE PANELS BEFORE SOLDERING PIN HEADERS\n- CHECK LEVELS OF ANY OLED SCREEN WITH THE PANELS BEFORE SOLDERING PIN HEADERS\n- CHECK LEVELS OF ANY OLED SCREEN WITH THE PANELS BEFORE SOLDERING PIN HEADERS\n\n**2021-01-23 1:03 AM**\n- Tried flashing on a Mac. Did not work.\n- Suspected faulty cables (USB-C to A). Was not the case.\n- Switched to Windows. Worked first time (USB-A to A).\n- Soldered the jacks and potentiometer.\n- Realized the screws are too short to reach from the panel to the spacer.\n    - Will have to be like this for now until I order another batch of components\n- CV 3's LED is always on. but it's too late and I'm tired.\n\n**2021-01-23 10:07 PM**\n- Reflowed CV 3's LED and the components that are in series to it.\n- It is still always on, but when I connect the USB keyboard to the module, it partially works\n    - Unlike other CV LEDs, it's either ON or OFF, it doesn't go from dim to full brightness depending on the voltage\n- Chipped a bit of the LED off while touching it up.\n- I don't know enough about electronics to troubleshoot this on my own. Nor do I have the energy to do this today, so I will leave it here.\n\n**2021-01-23 10:05 PM**\n- With the help of a friend, narrowed it down to a problem where CV output 3 is recieving high voltage.\n- When given 1 volts as an output, it was receiving 11.9V, thus making it turn brighter than others.\n- Also, the power switch for USB (U1) burned. My first magic smoke!\n    - I guess it couldn't handle my keyboard.\n- I should order replacement for U1 and a cheap usb keyboard.\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/30fb9719-ad12-4d46-af75-6d357e348a92.html","relUrl":"notes/30fb9719-ad12-4d46-af75-6d357e348a92.html"},{"doc":"RND STEP","title":"RND STEP","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.rnd-step","content":"\n# DivKid RND STEP\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/811ebbe1-23b3-463e-80d6-c5c5587cc0e9.html","relUrl":"notes/811ebbe1-23b3-463e-80d6-c5c5587cc0e9.html"},{"doc":"Rcd","title":"Rcd","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.rcd","content":"\n# 4MS Rotating Clock Divider\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/fd76bf19-77eb-4e0c-9f9a-f66dedf2d598.html","relUrl":"notes/fd76bf19-77eb-4e0c-9f9a-f66dedf2d598.html"},{"doc":"Performer","title":"Performer","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.performer","content":"\n# Westlicht Performer\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/5af19bbc-48db-46c2-9a5a-b19e5a37d57d.html","relUrl":"notes/5af19bbc-48db-46c2-9a5a-b19e5a37d57d.html"},{"doc":"Peaks","title":"Peaks","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.peaks","content":"\n# Mutable Instruments Peaks\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/914eb861-7974-479c-80e6-a0c913374fdc.html","relUrl":"notes/914eb861-7974-479c-80e6-a0c913374fdc.html"},{"doc":"Msk007","title":"Msk007","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.msk007","content":"\n# North Coast Synthesis MSK007 Leapfrog Filter\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/f3848b0c-6ba0-457e-a3f7-a4c37d9556ab.html","relUrl":"notes/f3848b0c-6ba0-457e-a3f7-a4c37d9556ab.html"},{"doc":"M185","title":"M185","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.m185","content":"\n# RYK M185\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/5562e1fe-a456-4ad8-af94-5a79212a5097.html","relUrl":"notes/5562e1fe-a456-4ad8-af94-5a79212a5097.html"},{"doc":"Klang-stadt","title":"Klang-stadt","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.klang-stadt","content":"\n# Frequency Central Klang Stadt\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/9e1c90a2-2eff-4748-930b-d308ab0b7b7f.html","relUrl":"notes/9e1c90a2-2eff-4748-930b-d308ab0b7b7f.html"},{"doc":"Kinks","title":"Kinks","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.kinks","content":"\n# Mutable Instruments Kinks\n\n[Official Website](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/kinks/)\n\n[Hardware repository](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/tree/master/kinks/hardware_design)\n\n## notes\n\n**2021-01-19 9:09 PM**\n- Sourced parts for two builds.\n- Q3 substituted for a renewed(I think) version.\n- 1M ohm resistors substituted as they were backordered.\n- There are some 0.1% resistors and DAMN they are expensive.\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/16b36d0a-883e-47f7-85f1-fefcbf721ed4.html","relUrl":"notes/16b36d0a-883e-47f7-85f1-fefcbf721ed4.html"},{"doc":"Es9","title":"Es9","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.es9","content":"\n# Expert Sleepers ES-9\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/2e143a82-c20b-40ca-81a2-c1b6bc0c43a2.html","relUrl":"notes/2e143a82-c20b-40ca-81a2-c1b6bc0c43a2.html"},{"doc":"Dtm","title":"Dtm","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.dtm","content":"\n# Manhattan Analogue DTM\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/6b6c3eef-ca71-4dd0-a04f-4ba923ac7efb.html","relUrl":"notes/6b6c3eef-ca71-4dd0-a04f-4ba923ac7efb.html"},{"doc":"0-coast","title":"0-coast","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.module.0-coast","content":"\n# MakeNoise 0-coast\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/75ed70b8-ede6-4d34-a7a3-e75a25f123ef.html","relUrl":"notes/75ed70b8-ede6-4d34-a7a3-e75a25f123ef.html"},{"doc":"Diy","title":"Diy","hpath":"cerebrarium.music.synth.diy","content":"\n# Synth DIY\n\n## Checklist\n### Ordering components\n#### Global\n- [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/)\n- [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/)\n- [Thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/)\n- [Aliexpress](https://aliexpress.com/)\n\n#### South Korea\n- [Devicemart](https://www.devicemart.co.kr/)\n- [Eleparts](https://www.eleparts.co.kr/)\n\n### Before you start\n### During the build\n### Before plugging in\n### Flashing and calibration\n\n## Ideas\n- Analog VU meter array\n    - An array of 4 or 8 Analog VU meters\n    - Audio in / out / multiple\n    - Backlight switch\n    - Attenuation (faders?

`runLegacySingleWorkspaceTest`\n    - `runLegacyMultiWorkspaceTest`\n    - These set up mocks for single/multi vault testing.\n        - example : [RenameNoteV2.test.ts](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/test/suite-integ/RenameNoteV2.test.ts#L131:L131)\n    - [arguments](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/test/testUtilsV3.ts#L70:L70)\n        - `ctx`\n            - [vscode extension context](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#ExtensionContext)\n            - collection of utilities private to an extension\n        - `preSetupHook`\n            - runs before init\n        - `postSetupHook`\n            - runs after init\n        - `preActivateHook`\n            - runs befor workspace activation\n        - `postActivateHook`\n            -\n- [runJestHarnessV2](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/58b3587f1e44f54635f77f7395f7b756f18e0c84/packages/common-test-utils/src/utils.ts#L119)\n    - use shimmed jest methods to assert equality of actual and expected test outcome.\n\n- engine test setup\n    1. initialize engine\n    2. seed it with fixtures for testing\n    - may require testing in multiple environments (plugin, CLI, server, engine)\n    - may require multiple test runners (jest / mocha)\n\n**2021-01-14**\n\n_Notes on pairing session_\n\nSession goal\n- Add a test for MarkdownPublishPod\n- Show how tests are set up for Dendron\n\nwatch\n\n```bash\ncd bootstrap/scripts\n./watch.sh\n```\n- Dendron is made up of a multiple typescript projects\n- This script will watch all of them and compile them when you make change to the code.\n\n\nTesting in Dendron\n- All tests are managed with jest.\n    - Except the plugin itself, which uses mocha\n        - mocha is very well integrated into VSCode's [test harness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_harness)\n- Any test code that are not testing plugin functionality are\n    - located in the `__tests__` directory\n    - in the file name formatted `TestName.spec.ts`\n- To run a test, use VSCode tasks\n    - `cmd` + `shift` + `p`, -> `Task: Run Task` in the command palette\n    - Select the appropriate task to run.\n        - These are vscode wrappers around bash scripts.\n    - In our case, we want to test `MarkdownPod.spec.ts`\n    - Type `npm:test:watch` in the task comman palette\n    - There will be a number of selections, marked with which project's test it will be running.\n        - Select the one marked with `pods-core`, as we are testing pods today.\n    - This will open a terminal and run `jest --watch` on the specific test we are interested in.\n        - Now jest will run all the tests for you every time you change your test code\n- Writing new tests\n    - Start a new [describe block](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#describename-fn), and give it an appropriate name.\n    - Write a new test case.\n        - Use `runEngineTest`\n            - Multiple versions of this exists\n            - Make sure you import the right version of this.\n                - This is a typescript thing (?)\n        - There are preset scenarios for testing\n            - These are `PreSetupHookFunctions`\n            - They set up hard-coded notes in a vault so that they can be used in a test\n    - Quick jest tip: use snapshots to grab a test result (something long that you don't really want to construct manually), and use that for your assertions\n        - These can be found in `__tests__/__snapshots__`\n        - Don't forget to remove the snapshot code for the final test code if it isn't necessary.\n    - Clean up any unused code / warnings\n- After writing all the tests, check again by running the entire test suite\n    - Run `Test: bootstrap` found under `Task: Run Task`\n        - This will all tests in all packages.\n        - We want to do this before commiting because Dendron is a mono-repo, and most packages have dependencies on each other.\n        - We want to make sure our changes aren't breaking something elsewhere.\n        - Github action that will automatically do this for every push will be coming soon.\n- If you want to be more careful, you can also test the plugin itself at this point.\n    - The above step tests every single package that is not a plugin.\n    - To run tests for the plugin itself, run `Extension Integ Tests (plugin-core)`, which can be found in the Run pane.\n\n**2021-01-20 9:19 PM**\n- What is `MarkdownPublishPod` (and the new markdown parser) actually doing?\n    - get note, given the file name.\n    - get processor (?)\n    - process given representation of a file(note.body) as configured on the processor\n    \n**2021-01-24 5:33 PM**\n- Some test cases to think about for `MarkdownPublishPod`\n    - empty note\n    - note with links\n        - wikilink\n        - relative link\n    - note with reference\n        - note reference\n        - block reference\n        - block range reference\n        - reference offset\n        - wildcard header reference\n        - wildcard child reference\n        - wildcard complex reference (child, then header, then offset)\n        - ~~recursive reference~~\n    - ~~note with tags?~~\n        - tags are just regular notes.\n    - ~~note with katex?~~\n        - not markdown\n\n**2021-01-25 12:17 AM**\n- pushed revised tests for `MarkdownPublishPod`\n- not sure what the best way to structure tests would be\n    1. bundle tests that are testing similar functionality into one test block\n    2. have them all separate.\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/739ad898-dfbf-403f-8cc6-073cfcca103e.html","relUrl":"notes/739ad898-dfbf-403f-8cc6-073cfcca103e.html"},{"doc":"Language","title":"Language","hpath":"cerebrarium.dev.lang","content":"\n# Languages\n\n((ref: [[cerebrarium.dev.lang.ts]]))\n((ref: [[cerebrarium.dev.lang.js]]))\n((ref: [[cerebrarium.dev.lang.python]]))\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/f6124744-941b-4903-95f2-bdf808d80c1c.html","relUrl":"notes/f6124744-941b-4903-95f2-bdf808d80c1c.html"},{"doc":"Ts","title":"Ts","hpath":"cerebrarium.dev.lang.ts","content":"\n# Typescript\n\n# Useful links\n[Typescript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/)\n\n# Notes\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/0364859b-4215-428b-af54-a1c26e022756.html","relUrl":"notes/0364859b-4215-428b-af54-a1c26e022756.html"},{"doc":"Python","title":"Python","hpath":"cerebrarium.dev.lang.python","content":"\n# Python\n\n## Notes\n- raw format strings are useful when composing regex patterns in verbose mode\n    ```python\n    import re\n    \n    pattern = rf\"\"\"\n    ^[{prefix}]?     # optionally match prefix at start\n    (?P<all>         # capture named group all\n        (?P<left>    # capture named group left\n            \\d+?     # lazily match digits\n        )\n        {infix}      # match infix\n        (?P<right>   # capture named group right\n            \\d+      # match digits\n        )\n    )\n    [{suffix}]?$     # optionally match suffix at start\n    \"\"\"\n\n    rx = re.compile(pattern, re.VERBOSE)\n\n    match = rx.match(some_string)\n    ```\n- testing out python regex\n    [pythex](https://pythex.org/)\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/a9254c14-fd25-4d81-b0e9-57652226ffed.html","relUrl":"notes/a9254c14-fd25-4d81-b0e9-57652226ffed.html"},{"doc":"Js","title":"Js","hpath":"cerebrarium.dev.lang.js","content":"\n# Javascript\n\n## Topics\n- [[Variable declaration|cerebrarium.dev.lang.js.variable]]\n\n## Tooling\n\n### [lodash](https://lodash.com/)\n> A modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.\n\n- [online lodash tester](https://codepen.io/travist/full/jrBjBz/)\n\n### [jest](https://jestjs.io/)\n> Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.

Apply the principle of least privilege.\n- Destructuring\n    - ECMAScript 2015 feature\n    - e.g.\n    ```js\n    let input = [1, 2];\n    let [first, second] = input;\n    console.log(first); // 1\n    console.log(second); // 2\n    ```\n    - equivalent to indexing.\n    - use `...` for remaining items (they can be omitted if you don't need them.)\n    ```js\n    let [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n    console.log(first); // 1\n    console.log(rest); // [2, 3, 4]\n    ```\n    - also works with objects\n    ```js\n    let o = {\n        a: \"foo\",\n        b: 12,\n        c: \"bar\",\n    };\n    let { a, b } = o;\n    ```\n    - type annotation with destructuring is confusing:\n    ```js\n    let { a, b }: { a: string; b; number } = o;\n    ```\n    - destructuring with default values\n    ```js\n    // b? means b is optional\n    function foo(o: { a: string; b?: number }) {\n        // give default value of b since it is optional\n        let { a, b = 1 } = o\n    }\n    ```\n    - function declaration with destructuring\n    ```js\n    type C = { a: string; b?: number };\n    function f({ a, b }: C): void {\n        //..\n    }\n    ```\n    - Anything but a simple destructuring gets extremely confusing. Use sparingly.\n- Spreading\n    - opposite of destructuring\n    ```js\n    let first = [1, 2];\n    let second = [3, 4];\n    let both = [0, ...first, ...second, 5]; // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    ```\n    - also works with objects\n    ```js\n    let defaults = { food: \"spicy\", price: \"$$\", ambiance: \"noisy\" }\n    let search = { ...defaults, food: \"rich\" }\n    // properties coming later in the spread object overwrites.\n    ```\n    - with object spreading, you lose methods.\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/bf8d4878-7f78-413c-97ef-c386bd6c0126.html","relUrl":"notes/bf8d4878-7f78-413c-97ef-c386bd6c0126.html"},{"doc":"Infra","title":"Infra","hpath":"cerebrarium.dev.infra","content":"\n![[cerebrarium.dev.infra.*]]\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/8dfd7938-ed8c-4aa2-9d23-5d52b76b2e83.html","relUrl":"notes/8dfd7938-ed8c-4aa2-9d23-5d52b76b2e83.html"},{"doc":"Terraform","title":"Terraform","hpath":"cerebrarium.dev.infra.terraform","content":"\n# Terraform\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/cc822085-033e-4e3f-9787-76c0964e39b6.html","relUrl":"notes/cc822085-033e-4e3f-9787-76c0964e39b6.html"},{"doc":"Aws","title":"Aws","hpath":"cerebrarium.dev.infra.aws","content":"\n# AWS\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/4e81cf27-9500-47fa-baf2-812edc43f0bd.html","relUrl":"notes/4e81cf27-9500-47fa-baf2-812edc43f0bd.html"},{"doc":"Git","title":"Git","hpath":"cerebrarium.dev.git","content":"\n# Git\n\n## Topics\n\n- Conventional commits\n[Website](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)\n\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/8995932b-55ea-4a91-8cc7-0e7dacc50943.html","relUrl":"notes/8995932b-55ea-4a91-8cc7-0e7dacc50943.html"},{"doc":"Art","title":"Art","hpath":"cerebrarium.art","content":"\n# Art\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/f52825ef-7efe-4373-9784-255b9a058deb.html","relUrl":"notes/f52825ef-7efe-4373-9784-255b9a058deb.html"},{"doc":"Scale Model","title":"Scale Model","hpath":"cerebrarium.art.scale-model","content":"\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/2ac4d9fb-c8cd-4368-b12c-559645ef28f5.html","relUrl":"notes/2ac4d9fb-c8cd-4368-b12c-559645ef28f5.html"},{"doc":"Maschinen Krieger","title":"Maschinen Krieger","hpath":"cerebrarium.art.scale-model.maschinen-krieger","content":"\n","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/629f9d11-4b72-411d-a83b-f44fb06c25bc.html","relUrl":"notes/629f9d11-4b72-411d-a83b-f44fb06c25bc.html"},{"doc":"Projects","title":"Projects","hpath":"cerebrarium.art.projects","content":"\n![[cerebrarium.art.projects.*]]","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/1c6afb1e-7d68-4052-b064-6936f77d549b.html","relUrl":"notes/1c6afb1e-7d68-4052-b064-6936f77d549b.html"},{"doc":"Accidental Contraptions","title":"Accidental Contraptions","hpath":"cerebrarium.art.projects.accidental-contraptions","content":"\n# Accidental Contraptions\n\n## Mission Statement\n\n## Scope\n\n## Milestone\n\n## Reference\n\n## Notes","url":"https://cerebrarium.garden/notes/e8b4de15-e967-4706-9aa8-ad1a02d16526.html","relUrl":"notes/e8b4de15-e967-4706-9aa8-ad1a02d16526.html"},{"doc":"Actionables","title":"Actionables","hpath":"cerebrarium.actionables","content":"\n# Actionables\n\n> A single place that lists immediately actionable tasks from various task.\n\n## workflow\n```\n1.
